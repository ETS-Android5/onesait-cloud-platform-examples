# Microservice Model Template

## Introduction
In this example you can find a simple implementation of a Machine Learning Model as Service (MaaS).

The example is the template used to new "ML" microservice in the platform, also it can be used to develop a more complex model integrated (or connected) with Onesait Platform.

## Objetives
The aim of this tutorial is to establish a common Model as a Microservice standard.
This way we pretend to increase step by step the complexity and functionalities of the OnesaitPlatform intelligence services.
